# SELF_DRIVING_CAR
 Based on Image Processing using Deep Learning + OpenCV
- A project based on Image Processing using Convolution Neural Networks + OpenCV.
- Pi CAM was used for all the real time image input.
- Raspberry Pi 3 was used for nominal real time image processing using open CV.
- The model was trained with 2000 images each for "left, right, straight, sharp left, sharp right"
- The motors were controlled using arduio UNO with serial communication.
